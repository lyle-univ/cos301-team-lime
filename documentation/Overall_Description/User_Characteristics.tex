Lastly the system aims to cater for the disabled. The disabilities which will be accomodated have not yet been fully clarified. But the same level of competence is expected from the disabled as from the general mobile user population to make use of the navigation features. This system is mostly geared toward the physically disabled in order to find the most accomodating routes to classes and buildings.
