Factors that could affect the requirements include compliance with the Protection of Private Information Act of 2013. The POPI act is applicable since user location data gets captured and assigned to a persistent ID and then stored in a database. This means that compliance requires certain additions to functional requirements such as asking the data-subject for consent when the app is opened for the very first time and allowing withdrawal of consent and destruction of identifiable data within a reasonable time. It could also potentially restrict certain functional requirements such as surveilance and analysis.

For the system to function as expected, we must assume that there will be sufficient wifi and GPS coverage and the sensors, when integrated, will provide sufficient accuracy to serve its purpuse. We also assume that map data will be available with a sufficient degree of accuracy and completeness to satisfy the requirements of the system.
