In regards to the Guest Users, they will have the same requirements of a Base User (See Base User Requirements). They won't have an associative ID linking them to the database seeing as they will not be logged in. As soon as they do so they will be seen as a Logged In User. This means they will not recieve any extra functionality from the system except for the base functionality.
