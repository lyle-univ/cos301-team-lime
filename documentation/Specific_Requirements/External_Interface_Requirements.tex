\subsubsection{User Interface}
The user interface for NavUP application will be specifically designed with users in mind, allowing them to have the best and easiest user interface possible. The aim is to make the user interface easy to navigate so that users spend less time trying to figure out how to use it.

We will offer a menu service to allow users of different levels to access their respective sections with ease, these sections would be Student, Lecturer and guest. There will also be a menu service after each user has selected their particular section so as to allow the user to choose their current need or inquiry. 

\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
The hardware interface to support the NavUP application would require a smartphone on which the application will be downloaded and run on. The smartphone would have to meet the standards of the operating system that the application is going to be developed on,as well as a colour screen with a resolution to match that specified later.
