The Web User Interface will be used by system administrators to manage the system, as such the Web UI for goals and activities will be created on this.

\FunqReq
{Add and create activities for the goals. Also set time frames to reach the goal, such as daily and weekly goals.}
{Set what the requirements to reach the goals are.}
{Be able to see which users have met the goals that have been set. This data should be able  to be sorted by time taken to reach the goal or by who achieved the highest score in order to decide on who can win a prize.}

\FuncReq
{The admin will be able to add what prizes are available to be won.}
{Each goal will be able to have a prize associated with it so that the user may see what they are eligible to win for completing the goal. Harder goals to achieve can then have better prizes associated with them to add to the incentive.}
{A contact form will be available to the admin so that any winners may be notified that they have won.}
