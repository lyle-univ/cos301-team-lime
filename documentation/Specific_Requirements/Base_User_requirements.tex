\FuncReq

\FuncReq
{Search for a location/venue on campus to be displayed on the map}
{The user needs to be able to search for a location/venue. This will involve a search bar (possible auto-complete functionality) where the user will enter the name of the location/venue. The mobile device will then search through it's database and indicate on the map when the location/venue has been found or display an appropriate prompt when the location/venue is not found.}
