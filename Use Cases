Navigation Subsystem
    These following things are not use cases or functional requirements, the are parts of some functional requirements:
	    Using current location

    Functional requirements for the system would be stated in the following manner:
        1.User shall input two points on the map and the system will return the fastest route.
        2.User shall request the fastest path from current location, determined by sensors, to destination.
            2.1.Destinations may be lecture halls, buildings, saved locations or arbitrary selected locations on the map.
