  Decisions made:
    Branching conventions will be a bug,feature,work in progress branch as well as a backup branch for each member.
    Uml software we will use will be umlet.
  Discussions:
    Started with a rough high level description of the system. First a layered architecture followed by some doodles describing what data flows where, from and to the datastore.
    In addition we started drafting the layout of the main document to facilitate future delegation.
