See the projects tab for the current progress of the project

Checkout the wip(work in progress) branch for the most recent work

Workflow conventions:

1. Pull before you push

2. In the projects tab, move work you want to work on from the TODO column into the In Progress column and assign yourself to the issue.

3. When complete, move your work from In Progress to the Review column to be reviewed and given feedback by a peer. After review, the peer will move the work to Done and close the issue.

3. Push bleeding edge work into wip

4. Merge a finished feature into feature branch

5. Merge each document version into master and label the version

6. Feature freeze will commence on Feb23 6PM. The bulk of work should be done before then, only fixes to typesetting, formatting and other touchups will be done after this time. Complete freeze will commence 2 hours before the deadline, this means that all issues should be resolved and closed before then. This is to prevent last minute changes having unintended consequences.
